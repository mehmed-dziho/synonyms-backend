- This project contains a _artillery_flow.yml_ file made for **artillery** (https://www.npmjs.com/package/artillery). This flow  be used to stress test /words POST endpoint by sending 4000 requests in 20 seconds using data from _words.csv_ which containts most frequent english words. App memory usage spiked from about 120MB to about 200MB and after the test was completed it stabilized again at 120MB. There is a customizable memory threshold set in app which can be used to notify when memory usage is too high.
- There is a github action _.github/workflows/node.js.yml_ which will deploy the app to heroku if tests are passed.
